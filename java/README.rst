============
Installation
============

This package is available on Maven Central and can be added to your project as follows:

**Maven**

.. code-block::

	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.opentracing.contrib.grpc</groupId>
			<artifactId>grpc-opentracing</artifactId>
			<version>0.1.0</version>
		</dependency>
	</dependencies>

**Gradle**

.. code-block::
	
	compile 'io.opentracing.contrib.grpc:grpc-opentracing:0.1.0'

**Note:** This package was developed using grpc-java v1.0.0-pre1.

==========
Quickstart
========== 

If you want to add basic tracing to your clients and servers, you can do so in a few short and simple steps, as shown below. (These code snippets use the grpc example's `GreeterGrpc`, generated by protocol buffers.)

**Servers**

- Instantiate a tracer
- Create a `ServerTracingInterceptor`
- Intercept a service 
    
.. code-block:: java

    public class YourServer {

        private int port;
        private Server server;

        private void start() throws IOException {
        
            Tracer tracer = yourOpenTracingTracer;
            ServerTracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor = new ServerTracingInterceptor(tracer);

            server = ServerBuilder.forPort(port)
                .addService(tracingInterceptor.intercept(someServiceDef))
                .build()
                .start();
        }
    }

**Clients**

- Instantiate a tracer
- Create a `ClientTracingInterceptor`
- Intercept the client channel

.. code-block:: java

	public class YourClient {

		private final ManagedChannel channel;
  		private final GreeterGrpc.GreeterBlockingStub blockingStub;

		public YourClient(String host, int port) {

			channel = ManagedChannelBuilder.forAddress(host, port)
				.usePlaintext(true)
				.build();
		
			Tracer tracer = yourOpenTracingTracer;
			ClientTracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor = new ClientTracingInterceptor(tracer)

			blockingStub = GreeterGrpc.newBlockingStub(tracingInterceptor.intercept(channel));
		}
	}

==============
Server Tracing
==============

A `ServerTracingInterceptor` uses default settings, which you can override by creating it using a `ServerTracingInterceptor.Builder`.

- `withOperationName(String operationName)`: Sets the operation name for all spans created for the intercepted service. Default is the name of the RPC method.
- `withStreaming()`: Logs to the server span whenever a message is received.
- `withVerbosity()`: Logs to the server span additional events, such as message received, half close (client finished sending messages), and call complete. Default only logs if a call is cancelled.  
- `withTracedAttributes(ServerRequestAttribute... attrs)`: Sets tags on the server span in case you want to track information about the RPC call. See `ServerRequestAttribute.java`_ for a list of traceable request attributes.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: java

    ServerTracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor = new ServerTracingInterceptor
        .Builder(tracer)
        .withStreaming()
        .withVerbosity()
        .withOperationName("service-name")
        .withTracedAttributes(ServerRequestAttribute.HEADERS, 
            ServerRequestAttribute.METHOD_TYPE)
        .build();

==============
Client Tracing
==============

A `ClientTracingInterceptor` also has default settings, which you can override by creating it using a `ServerTracingInterceptor.Builder`.

- `withOperationName(String operationName)`: Sets the operation name for all spans created for this intercepted client. Default is the name of the RPC method.
- `withStreaming()`: Logs to the client span whenever a message is sent or a response is received.
- `withVerbosity()`: Logs to the client span additional events, such as call started, message sent, half close (client finished sending messages), response received, and call complete. Default only logs if a call is cancelled.  
- `withTracedAttributes(ClientRequestAttribute... attrs)`: Sets tags on the client span in case you want to track information about the RPC call. See `ClientRequestAttribute.java`_ for a list of traceable request attributes.

**Example**:

.. code-block:: java

    ClientTracingInterceptor tracingInterceptor = new ClientTracingInterceptor
        .Builder(tracer)
        .withStreaming()
        .withVerbosity()
        .withOperationName("client-name")
        .withTracingAttributes(ClientRequestAttribute.ALL_CALL_OPTIONS,
            ClientRequestAttribute.HEADERS)
        .build();

===================================
Integrating with Other Interceptors
===================================

Although we provide ServerTracingInterceptor.intercept(service) and ClientTracingInterceptor.intercept(channel) methods, you don't want to use these if you're chaining multiple interceptors. Instead, use the following code (preferably putting the tracing interceptor at the top of the interceptor stack so that it traces the entire request lifecycle, including other interceptors):

**Servers**

.. code-block:: java

    server = ServerBuilder.forPort(port)
        .addService(ServerInterceptors.intercept(service, someInterceptor, 
            someOtherInterceptor, serverTracingInterceptor))
        .build()
        .start();

**Clients**

.. code-block:: java

    blockingStub = GreeterGrpc.newBlockingStub(ClientInterceptors.intercept(channel,
        someInterceptor, someOtherInterceptor, clientTracingInterceptor));
